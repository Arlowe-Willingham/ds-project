You can replace the text in this section with your own text such as an introduction to your site.

In each of the posts below you will find instructions on how to add certain features. All of these posts have the "How-To" category. You can safely delete them from your repository if you are done referencing them. 

You will notice each post has its own teaser image. You can specify what that image is in the YAML front matter (the code at the top of the file between the two sets of `---`) on each post. If a post is made with no teaser image specified in its YAML front matter, then your site will display a default teaser image, which you can set easily. Just delete the 'teaser.jpg' file in the /assets/images folder and replace it with the file of an image of your choice. Make sure you rename your new image file 'teaser.jpg'.
